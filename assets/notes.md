Join us at Hopgrass Farm for a day filled with love, laughter, and celebration among our closest friends and family. Hopgerass farm is the loving family home of the Monro's, full of memories, and we cannot wait to share this day together with all of you there.

Guests are welcome to arrive from 3:30 PM, giving plenty of time to settle in and enjoy the surroundings before the celebrations begin. We'll start the afternoon with a ring warming ceremony, where each of our guests will have the chance to hold our wedding rings and offer a silent wish or blessing before we exchange them. It’s a simple but meaningful way to include everyone we love in the heart of our ceremony.

Afterwards, the music will start, and the rest of the day will flow naturally — good food, good company, and plenty of time to dance, talk, and enjoy the evening together. Expect a laid-back atmosphere with great tunes, our favorite local food, friends family and dancing.

Catering will be provided by our favourite local wood-fired pizza team, serving up fresh slices throughout the evening. Beer and bubbles will be available, but we kindly ask guests to bring along any extra drinks you’d like to enjoy so there’s enough to keep everyone going late into the night.

For those driving, there’s a field beside the barn reserved for parking. If you’re travelling by train, Hungerford Station is just a 15-minute walk away across the Hungerford Marsh. Camping is warmly welcomed, and there’s plenty of space to pitch a tent if you’d like to stay overnight and soak up the whole weekend vibe.

The dress code is smart, but we encourage everyone to keep comfort in mind — especially with the countryside setting and plenty of dancing ahead.

We can’t wait to share this day with you — save the date and see you then!
